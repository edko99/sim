# sim
Discrete event simulation library, inspired by GPSS, to be used in Deno projects.

## Current capabilities
- Scheduling of events with simulated time
- Resources, with impatience
- Basic charts (using Vega-Lite)

## Intended
- Better docs (for now, see tests)
- Ability for processes to get more information about the simulated environment (resource stats, etc.)
- Better charts
- Statistics (multiple runs, ANOVA, etc.)
