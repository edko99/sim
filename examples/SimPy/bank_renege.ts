A counter with a random service time and customers who renege.
Based on https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/bank_renege.html

This example models a bank counter and customers arriving at random times.
Each customer has a certain patience. She waits to get to the counter until sheâ€™s at the end of her tether.
If she gets to the counter, she uses it for a while before releasing it.

New customers are created by the source process every few time steps.
